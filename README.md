Thanks to the aweseome hueh_bashlibrary ... https://github.com/markusproske/hue_bashlibrary

huemem.sh tries to remember the state the lights were in so that next time you turn them on it will return them to that state...

Only tested under cygwin but it should work on linux fine as well... doesn't work in GoW (because it didn't like my Strawberry version of Perl).
